##### Demonstrating Markdown!
Using Markdown, we can write in *italics*, **bold text**, ~~strikethrough~~, and combine these in **_interesting_** ways.

We can also write...
1. Ordered lists!
2. You can see that this list is indented slightly.
- We can also make bulletpoints for unordered lists!
* we can use asterisks for these
- or minuses
+ or plusses! All work.

[Creating links with markdown is easy too.](https://www.google.com)
[We can also make inline-style links with titles](https://www.google.com "Google")
[Reference-style links...][this is some reference text]


[this is some reference text]: https://www.google.com

Images are easy too: ![A badly-drawn red smiley face](https://github.com/Hercynia/Hercynia.github.io/blob/main/RandomImage.png "This image is made by me, and therefore does not violate any copyright law.")

If we want to, we can even make inline code blocks, `like this`
We can write whole blocks of code, too, instead of making it just inline, for example:
```we can write code in this format```

Blockquotes can be used to imitate reply text
> like this.
